# GIPHY call app

Uses Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX, etc.

Press the animals buttons and GIFs of that animal will appear.
Add a new animal button (or two or three or more) and that animal will appear when you click the new button.
Click an image to make it animate or stop animating.
Fun for the whole family.
